#### notes 8/2/2021 Monday:  
Code will be most difficult for intermediate coders, those who only know Python and have been coding for a few years.  

That's me.  I only know Python, and spent 1 full year learning Python basics and 2nd year learning data science libraries in Python.  Brings in concepts from other programming languages.  Later in 2021 interviews, says Python will not be the future of ML.  I think he is referring to SWIFT, but SWIFT for Tensorflow is dead, and Chris Lattner is no longer developing it.  I Think Python will stay because of the huge libraries and user base.  Lower level code will be developed to work with Python for GPU and faster speed.  Maybe even better math and symbolic representation.  Parts that Jeremy does not like about Python.  

To learn fastai, learn the parts that are not Pythonic.
