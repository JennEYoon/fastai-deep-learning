# fastai-dl-study repo

### Update, September 2022:  
  * Started 2022 version of Fast.AI class.  
  * Fastbook and fastai library folders -- updated, July 2022.  

This repo was reorganized on 10/18/2021.  My purpose was to consolidate my study notes from "deep-learning" repo with fastai v2 library study and fastai based apps.
Github fastai/fastbook download was also refreshed.  Last commit to that repo was around the end of May 2021. 

 * My study and work products are in "fastbook" folder.    
 * fastai v2 software is in "fastai" folder.   
 * apps folders have my experimentations.

For source Github repo:  see https://github.com/fastai/fastbook  and  https://github.com/fastai/fastai  


### fastai-app repo, June 11, 2021 note  

 * app1 folder -- my testing notebooks, chp 1, 2, 4, 5  
 * fastai folder -- full fastai v2 library, for studying  
 * fastbook folder -- full copy of book notebooks, for studying   

Smaller repo size, easier to start in binder.org  
Colab, one place to look for fastai notebooks.  

### Binder:
Add environment.yml file to root - done.  
**fastai20env.yml** - has fastai version 2, fastcore. 
  Need nbdev to use scripts, for converting notebooks to .py file, for documentation in notebook.  

### Colab:  
PyTorch works with both CPU and GPU engines now.  
With Colab open and logged into my account, can upload notebook from local laptop.  
Exported model trained on GPU, re-export model from CPU-engine, to import/train further on CPU.
