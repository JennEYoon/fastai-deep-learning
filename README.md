# fastai-dl-study repo

This repo was reorganized on 10/18/2021.  My purpose was to consolidate my study notes from "deep-learning" repo with fastai v2 library study and fastai based apps.
Github fastai/fastbook download was also refreshed.  Last commit to that repo was around the end of May 2021. 

 * My study and work products are in "fastbook" folder.    
 * fastai v2 software is in "fastai" folder.   
 * apps folders have my experimentations.  

For Fastai Class website: see https://www.fast.ai/   
For source Github repo:  see https://github.com/fastai/fastbook  and  https://github.com/fastai/fastai  


### fastai-app repo, June 11, 2021 note  

 * app1 folder -- my testing notebooks, chp 1, 2, 4, 5  
 * fastai folder -- full fastai v2 library, for studying  
 * fastbook folder -- full copy of book notebooks, for studying  
 * my-work folder -- my working notebooks for fastai 2020 version class.  

Smaller repo size, easier to start in binder.org  
Colab, one place to look for fastai notebooks.  

### Fastbook, fastai 2020 class:  
Moved my ***fastbook*** and ***fastai 2020 class*** folders to this repo from ***deep-learning*** repo.  
Combine with other fastai related folders, fastai v2 package.  Add nbdev later.  

#### June 12, 2021 Update:  
Part 2 youtube class videos are still not available.  In the mean time, watching 2019 version of Part 2 class on youtube is useful.  Fastai library explanation is helpful for understanding the v2 package, even thought the 2019 class videos refers to fastai v1 package.  Package v2 reuse v1's parts and function.  Parts in v2 are inside a wrapper or a module.  Code walkthrough videos for fastai v2 package is also helpful.  Fastbook nb 19 (book chapter 19) had helpful information on understanding fastai package.  Chapter is still at a high level, so need to dive into actual code.  See github for fastai/fastai repo.  

### Binder:
Add environment.yml file to root - done.  
**fastai20env.yml** - has fastai version 2, fastcore. Need nbdev to use scripts.  

### Colab:  
PyTorch works with both CPU and GPU engines now.  
With Colab open and logged into my account, can upload notebook from local laptop.  
Exported model trained on GPU, re-export model from CPU-engine, to import/train further on CPU.
