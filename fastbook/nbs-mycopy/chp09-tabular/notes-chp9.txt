# Chp9 Tabular, Kaggle API, bluebook for bulldozers

Edit path for 5 images to ../../images path.  

Google Colab, find a way to point to /.kaggle/kaggle.json folder from my mounted google drive.  
Need to change fastai code to use different destination.  

Alternatively, find an easy way to upload all data files, already downloaded and unzipped on my laptop, 
To Colab working drive.  Need a way to point NB to mounted google drive for data.
"wget" learn.  

Mounted user drive is /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks"
Kaggle path: /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/.kaggle/kaggle.json
Another kaggle path: '/content/drive/MyDrive/.kaggle/kaggle.json'

Don't use '~' root for mounted gdrive. This points to Linux bin. 

import os
with open('filename', 'rw') as f:  
   os.dump(api_key, f)
   
api_key is kaggle token.  

Colab -- no access to "/root/.kaggle/' folder.  Can't rename folder using . in folder name.  
This option fails, so need a way to change fastai code path to /content/drive.
