>F.conv2d()
>F is fastai import from PyTorch, F is class?  
>PyTorch torch.nn.functional spec:   
>input: input tensor of shape(minibatch, in_channels, iH, iW), iH is image rows   
>weight: filters of shape (out_channels, in_channels, kH, kW), kH is kernel rows  

>torch.Size([64, 1, 28, 28])   
>   64 images in datablock, 1 channel color b/w, 28 rows, 28 cols in image.
