# Studying fastbook, work in progress.  

### Previous Study Chapters - review later  

#### Chp 1 - intro  
Lots of good information on how to study and how to do project.  
Prefer one in-depth project versus lots of small projects.  
But can start by doing some small projects, small extensions of 
fastbook provided notebooks.  

#### Chp 2 - web app  
Finish doing and host on my datasciy.com  
AWS hosting.  

#### Chp 4 - MNIST Basics   
Try research project extension.  
Review when doing Chp 17, nn foundations.  

#### Chp 5 - Pets  
Good review for end-to-end model using Resnet50 pretrained model.  

#### Chp 6 - Multicategory  
Good review, multicategory, cross-entropy loss, pretrained.  

#### Chp 9, Tabular - Meetup main  
Presented random forest twice.  
Do later parts, re-run model with bluebook-for-bulldozers data.  

#### Chp 10 - NLP  
 * Try character token PyTorch project.  
 * Look for Word2Vec library tutorial.  

#### Chp 11 - Midlevel data, fastai  
Not sure what this is doing.  
Does it make more sense now? After doing Chp 19 and 
looking at fastai source code?  

#### Chp 18, Cam Hooks  
Explain how to look inside model training, 
hightlights areas of image where learning was high.  
Finished reading. Look at code later in detail.  

#### Chp 20, Conclusion  
Finished  


### Currently Studying Chapters  

#### Chp 12, NLP Deep Dive  
Good, do this for July 2021 small group.  

#### Chp 8, Collaborative Filtering, IMDb movies  
Run model, try variations.  
Watch movies.  

#### Chp 7, Sizing and TTA -- improve model  
Various ways to improve image learning.  
Run models, try a lot of different variations.  

#### Chp 19, learner - fastai  
Has info about working with fastai datablock, datasets, 
dataloaders, and fastai learner module.  
Finished reading first part.  
Now applying to Amazon Rainforest project.   

### Remaining Chapters  

#### Chp 15, Architecture Details  
Discuss various architectures, what they are good for.  

#### Chp 16, Accel SGD  
Optimizing SGD, different tweaks.  

#### Chp 17. Neural Network from Foundations  
Has math, numpy code, for 2 layer nn.  
Good review. Do this one soon.
