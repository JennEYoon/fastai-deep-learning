Skimmed, code needs detailed work over, while comparing to fastai and PyTorch libraries.  

ULMfit, model looks like a U.  
Connections from original inputs to post CNN layers.  Segmentation requires regeneration of image in detail from low resolution after CNN filters. Need to combine with unfiltered image weights.  

Segmentation problem is a harder image problem.  

Siamese network, compare 2 images to see if the subjects match.  

Model needs to be comples enough to capture the subtle points.  
Start with a reasonable model, not too shpimple.  
Data try to increase as much as possible, more labels, create ways to get labels, train on other kinds of labels, data augmentation in many ways, try mixup.  
Then add regularization, or skip last 2 layers, add skiped layers of different kinds throughout the model.  But only if overfit.  First get to overfit.
