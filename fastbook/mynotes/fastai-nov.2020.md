# Fastai Class 2020 - my notes  

#### Nov 26, 2020  

  * Installed fastai on my laptop. Ubuntu version.  
    - Created new conda env.  Python version 3.6  
    - Exported conda env, compared with posted on fastai github. More extensive.  
    - Install -c fastai fastai (includes all other python libraries)  
    
  * Video Lesson 3 - covers fastbook nb2, but goes into more depth.  
    - To see parameters of fastai functions, move pointer to inside ( ) shift+click [shift+tab]. 
      Dropdown menu with full parameters.  Demoed for data augmentation settings.  
    - To examine fastai package code, use "nbs" folder.  Easier to view, full documentation.  
      Ex vision:  fastai/nbs/07_vision.core.ipynb   
      https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/nbs/07_vision.core.ipynb  
    - #hide, :s, :note -- commands for producing printed book.  
    - @decorator is used a lot in code.  Class method and function calls.  
    - In Data Cleanup step, interactive combo-box selection -- is a ***ipywidgets***.  
      Looks very simple. Has numerical slider, check box, button-click, combo-selection box, image show, video player, upload file function.  Can hide all notebook except widget and markdown text cell.  "interact" for one and done, and "interactive" for holding onto object and doing stuff.  
    - Voila is a browser-rendering service, so users who do not know about Jupyter Notebook can interact with "widgets".  
    - Can deploy to mybinder.org with Voila.  Not using GPU, but OK for verifying 1 image.  
    - For mobile phone deployment - use a standard server and connect phone to it.  
    - Where is the data?  Bear images in example?  
    
  * Later - Ubuntu workspace remove:  
    * Fastai folders, except keep 1.  Maybe on C:/python side.  Update from Github.  
    * Coursera CL4 downlaods, delete all except 1. Already on Github.  Large datafiles, keep in C drive, not upload to Github. 
      Keep Google Drive link share for large data files, pre-built model files.
