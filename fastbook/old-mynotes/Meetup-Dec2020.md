All's well.  
Suprisingly 2 out of 3 presented.  

To post on Slack and Meetup, schedule for 2020.  

Jan 2020:  
  * Holden - present something (also will help me with geospatial libraries)  
  * Peter - 2nd half of nb4  
  * Deborah - moderate Q&A from notebooks 1-4.  
  * Also plan to do a group project together in 2021.
